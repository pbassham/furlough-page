My family and I have been serving as church planting missionaries to Thailand since 2010. My wife and 3 beautiful daughters.

This is to introduce you to our family and the ministry God has given us. After reviewing the information, if the Lord leads, we would be honored for the opportunity to partner with you through prayer and/or financial support.

Thank you for your consideration!

2019 Furlough
=============

Maybe just make a PDF download link

To prepare for the next season of ministry, we are taking our first full furlough since arriving in Thailand 5 years ago. The Lord has worked mighty in our lives and ministry and we would love to share it with you and your church family.


Needing to raise additional support
-----------------------------------

 When arriving in Thailand years ago, most of what we would do was abstract and unknown. Now we know exactly what the ministry that the Lord would lead us to looks like, and how much it costs.

 Initially, we had thought we would be on the outer edge of Bangkok, but the Lord led us to plant our church right in the center. The opportunities are amazing, but the cost is as well. Everything is significantly more expensive than a less ambitious plan. We have taken a risk for His Kingdom, and the Lord has provided up until this point, but we are desperately needing to raise additional monthly support to be able to advance into the next stage of ministry.

 We have started right in the middle

 In addition, our family has almost doubled in size and will be needing to put our 3 girls through school.

Our Current Ministry
====================

What does it look like?

Daily Discipleship
------------------

 Pic gallery of this

 The heart of our ministry has always been daily discipleship and Bible study. We started with just 2 around my desk before the church was even started, and it has grown and adapted over time, but consistency involved the daily discipleship with the group of people interested in learning.

 Usually lasting several hours each day, we start with prayer, discuss any current questions from their own reading and growth, and then we put a passage on the board and dig through it together, learning how to be a Bible student.

 This simple habit has been the foundation of our growth.

Weekly - Services
-----------------

 6 Days a week we have various meetings, services, discipleship times, classes, and activities.

 Sundays start early, preaching easily goes an hour, we break for a meal together, and then come together again for a second hour to hour-and-a-half of classes.

 Lori has done a fantastic job discipling and organizing kids church, workers, and other activities, and we have seen several children make professions of faith.

 The Lord has given us a great music team of professionally trained musicians that have come together and serve the Lord and our church faithfully each week.

 Guys training for ministry preach short messages, teach offering devotionals, longer messages, and are involved in teaching different classes.

 Ladies give of their time and money each week to prepare a meal every Sunday afternoon, and we eat as a church together before the 2nd service/Sunday school time to follow.

Special Events
--------------

### English classes

 English has proven to be a very effective way to reach out, meet new people, serve the community, and give people a chance to get to know, for many of them, the first Christian they have ever known and the first church they have ever walked into.

 We have changed how we have done it almost every term, but have had hundreds and hundreds of people come to English classes (up to 500 registering at one time!) and scores and scores visit church as a result.

 It provides a non-threatening opportunity for them to visit and see that Christians dont have 3 heads, and as the church has grown, gives members an opportunity to get to know more people and share the Gospel with them. Before and after class it is great to see Gospel conversations happening all over the building.

### Events

 Christmas seems to be the most effective holiday to promote, and we have been blessed to have people that have the heart and ability to make it very effective. Without missionary money, each year the church has been able to gather money on their own to buy small prizes and presents, promote through various ways, write and put on plays, and see literally hundreds come to hear the Gospel. It is a beautiful time to see the church body working together.

Producing Materials
-------------------

 In a country of 0.7% Christian, and no Christian heritage, there is a dearth of materials. Most things that American churches take for granted do not exist in Thai. I would not be surprised if there were less than 1000 total Christian books, of any kind, in Thai.

 So, since everything is an opportunity, we have done a few projects thus far. Some official, some unofficial.

### Bible Software resources

-  Thai Strong's Bible Concordance

-  Thai Bible Encyclopedia

-  Thai Bible Study Notes

-  Thai Topical / Cross reference resource

-  Thai Topical / Cross reference resource

Media Outreach

 Bangkok is the \#2 global city on Facebook, so needless to say, we have tried to use it.

 2000 people follow our little church's page where post the Live stream of our services, sermon videos, devotionals, events, and other useful content.

### Youtube

 Along with church services, we have also put up the Entire New Testament as a type of Audio/Video Bible that will live in posterity.

Landscape
=========

Bangkok
-------

### 14 Million People --- Think a bad neighborhood in New York City, not village huts

Religion
--------

 Need pictures here to illustrate

 99% Buddhist 0.7% Christian

 Folk Buddhism, which is largely more akin to spiritism and superstition than strict Buddhism. The questions that we address often have to do with spirits, demons, spiritual power and help, and what they need to do to have a "better life," basically meaning, what rituals do they need to perform to try our God out.

Culture
-------

 Thailand is a very homogenous culture with a very strong national and religious identity. We often hear rejection in the form of "I'm Thai" rather than "I'm Buddhist" because to the average Thai, they are one in the same.

 Persecution vs. Cultural Pressure: Thai have very strong family and community bonds, and are on the opposite end of the "American Individualism" spectrum, culturally speaking. While this is not a bad quality, it is a source of serious pressure for a new believer. A large percentage of people in our ministry face constant pressure from their families and community for being a Christian and sadly, many have turned away as a result.

Our Location in the City
------------------------

-  Thousands of people pass in front of our church every day

Gif of people passing by

-  22k per sq kilo ---not in a village hut, but more like in the dark side of NY

-  Prosperity preaching all around --- buddhist or Christian

-  Brothels all around \# within 1 mile
